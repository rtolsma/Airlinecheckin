This is a simple android app that I created to solve the problem of checking in to solve the problem of constanly having to manually check-in to Southwest Airlines for every single flight. This app has a simple user interface, where you are able to create requests to be automatically be sent out at a future date.

I used this project to become familiar with common android libraries and development patterns including: 

Very, very, very basic unit testing with ###Robolectric, Junit 4, and Mockito

### Dagger
dependency injection design pattern

### Otto Eventbus and Handlers 
for events across multiple threads (although I've learned recently that using a RxJava Subject is a better way to handle this nowadays)

### Java 8 Lambda functions 
with Retrolambda, for passing functions as parameters with the OOP interface design pattern

### Realm 
for persistent storage using stateful objects with primitive types
