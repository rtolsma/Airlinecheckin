    This is a small document that I'll use to record my thoughts on Design



    **Model**

   Send Login data in an HTTP request to the node.js server, at the correct time, which will submit the request to the
   Airline website. After request is sent, get back flight data/seat info and text/email to client or use a notification.


   **Controllers...Fragments**
   Use the DialogFragment to create the Login data, which will be sent back to the ListFragment in a Logins object, that stores
   data in Realm. On the Floating Action button click, call the method in the ListFragment to show the dialog, and then retrieve the
   Login object from that instance. Use adapter, to sort Logins based off of Date.

   A login List Item should show Airlines, date, time, and names. When clicked, the LoginDialogFragment should be shown, reflecting
   the data on the Login object being represented, then save any adjustments made to this login.

   Use a preference activity to give options for Notifications, texts, emails, and Donate to developer option.
